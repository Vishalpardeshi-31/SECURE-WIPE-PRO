# 🔐 Secure wipe pro – Verifiable Secure Data Erasure for a Circular Economy


Secure wipe pro is a secure, cross-platform data wiping application designed to build trust in electronic device recycling and IT asset disposal. It enables users to irreversibly erase data from devices while generating tamper-proof, digitally signed wipe certificates that can be independently verified.

With a simple one-click interface and offline usability, Secure wipe pro addresses one of the biggest barriers to e-waste recycling: fear of data recovery and breaches.

# 🚨 Problem

India generates over 1.75 million tonnes of e-waste annually, yet millions of old laptops and smartphones remain unused or improperly discarded.
The primary reason is data security anxiety—users fear sensitive personal or organizational data may be recovered even after deletion.

Existing data sanitization tools are:

Too complex for the general public

Expensive for individuals and small recyclers

Lacking verifiable proof of erasure


As a result, over ₹50,000 crore worth of IT assets are hoarded, blocking circular economy efforts.
